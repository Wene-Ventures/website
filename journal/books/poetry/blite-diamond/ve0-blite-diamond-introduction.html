        <div> 
            <p>At the peak of the slavery era in Britain, a British community bought several enslaved Tanzanians from the slave market to further their community and get help when needed. </p>
            <p>In an unexpected twist, the first and only mixed-race child is born, and because of it, things turn upside down for both slaves and masters in this community. Some see her birth as a hope for unity and equality, while others see it as an abomination that needs to be corrected. </p>
            <p>Her slave family calls her black, while her free family calls her White. Her mother names her Mondala, while her father names her Diana. Without an identity or known purpose, her name ends up being Blite Diamond since she is both Black & White and Diana & Mondala.</p>
            <p>Will she successfully know her purpose and take part in bringing a new change, or will she cause pain to both her families? </p>
            <p>After a series of events caused mainly by the birth of Blite Diamond, a significant change is needed to help 
            <p>You will find Diana, and Mondala used interchangeably depending on who is addressing her. If she is addressed by her white family (The Masters), then she is called Diana, however, she is called Mondala by her black family (The Slaves)</p>
