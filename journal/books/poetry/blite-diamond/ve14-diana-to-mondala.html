        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                Just because we share a body,
                doesn’t mean I have to like you,
                You make my skin a little foggy,
                and make all my clothes see-through,
                You can act strong to everybody,
                but I know what is inside you,
                A girl who resents her body,
                for its color and its dark view.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Because of you, I am despised,
                and my beauty is ignored,
                I hope that I won’t get prized,
                after your mother gets dad bored,
                Come on why do you look surprised,
                knowing you are cheap to afford?
                Because of me, you are disguised,
                it’s I who is always adored.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                We agreed for the night to be yours,
                while the sun belongs to me,
                Why do you take me on tours,
                every night to the big tree?
                Don’t you see you are being lured?
                How can you be so carefree?
                There will never be a cure,
                to a white man’s whip and decree.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                You disgrace my girlhood,
                by admiring circumcision,
                Please just use me as firewood,
                if you believe in superstition,
                On the wrong path to adulthood,
                you are causing our division,
                If I see further likelihood,
                I will make a hard decision.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                You run from intellectuals,
                just to fall for a shamba boy?
                Are you sure you aren’t mental?
                For I will not marry my toy,
                He is thinner than a petal,
                and nothing but a plowboy,
                All he can do is be ungentle,
                for he walks without his joy.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Just kill yourself please kill yourself,
                no one likes you or your mother,
                Kill yourself come on are you deaf?
                You are stubborn like your father,
                Use the knife from my mother’s shelf,
                or a panga from your brothers,
                So I can remain by myself,
                free from your complaints and bother.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I Don’t really hate us you know,
                or our heritage of ngoni,
                It’s just that the more I grow,
                the more I drift and feel lonely,
                So I have to go with the flow,
                and just say words that are stony,
                Kindly bear with my ugly roars,
                for they help me be less thorny.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Remember this Diana,
                with a song from the mansion,
                there is nothing like karma, Santa,
                or black fashion, terms invented by grandma,
                justifying her selfish kind actions,
                so do not be a charmer, by giving slaves bigger
                rations, do you want to be the next governor?
                Be a master with passion,
                White Diamond you are and slavery is your calling."
