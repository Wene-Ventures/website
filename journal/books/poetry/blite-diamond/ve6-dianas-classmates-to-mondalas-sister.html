        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Girl 1:</b>
				Do I hate you?
				Yes, I do,
				There I said it,
				what will you do?
				... just have to face it,
				no one likes the mini you,
				Running to tell auntie?
				So, she can do me bad voodoo?
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Girl 2:</b>
				Eeeeeeeew,
				did you just touch me?
				what's wrong with you,
				your skin stings like a bee,
				you are worse than your nephew,
				who's always on his knees,
				shuu shuu it's your curfew,
				before I stroke you, please flee.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Girl 3:</b>
				Oh, what is that smell?
				is that a shoe from the basement?
				I see they taught you well,
				using cooking oil as an ointment,
				your stink rings like a bell,
				messes up with my thought arrangement,
				all truths are mine to tell,
				you will wait a while for your engagement.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Girl 4:</b>
				Girl! don't you have a mirror,
				a comb, or a toothbrush?
				and please dare not say,
				it is because you had to rush,
				your people are full of crazy,
				and in pure lack of vision,
				can't believe that to this day,
				you cherish female circumcision!
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Boy 1:</b>
				Oh, mighty my,
				what do we have here?
				with you, I cannot lie,
				I like the curves on your rear,
				don't feel bad or cry,
				your prince boy is right here,
				too bad I am an engineer,
				after my golden work I disappear.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Boy 2:</b>
				It's Halloween today,
				as it has been for years,
				since you came we can't play,
				due to nightmares and fears,
				everything yea to you is nay,
				we clearly aren't your peers,
				Please, oh please do not delay,
				to act on your suicidal tears.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                <b>Boy 3:</b>
				Hey girly girl,
				don't listen to these haters,
				to me, you are like a Perl,
				covered with crushed papers,
				you will wait just a while,
				but freedom comes no later,
				don't let them see you cry,
				show them the alligator.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Remember this Diana,
				with a song from the mansion,
				there is nothing like karma, Santa,
				or black fashion, terms invented by grandma,
				justifying her selfish kind actions,
				so do not be a charmer, by giving slaves bigger
				rations, do you want to be the next governor?
				Be a master with passion,
				White Diamond you are and slavery is your calling."
