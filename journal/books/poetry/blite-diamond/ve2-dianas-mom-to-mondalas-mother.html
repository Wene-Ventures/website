        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                For nine years I made him cry,
				slowly his love began to burn,
				Despite how hard we tried,
				all my stomach did was run,
				In nine months you made him smile,
				I could see it with every turn,
				In my bed now you lie,
				perhaps you possess a better charm.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                How is any of this my fault?
				while I am the victim,
				My marriage is on halt,
				thanks to your cries and rhythms,
				Diamond is his vault, so through her,
				I will reach him,
				But you are my salt, and through you,
				I will teach him.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Although it was I,
				who permitted his transgression,
				Because it was I,
				who required his attention,
				No more can I lie,
				all I go through now is tension,
				And so you have to die,
				to stop my imaginations.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                You dare call me rude,
				for raising your daughter?
				Away from the dudes,
				and pure for the quarter,
				Would you rather intrude,
				and let her be slaughtered?
				With them who are crude,
				like charcoal or used mortars?
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I see you in the woods,
				clapping and dancing,
				Blowing those tubes,
				while panting and chanting,
				your god sure is rude,
				doing nothing but glancing,
				Welcome to the neighborhood,
				of baby masters and white Kings.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                This daughter is mine,
				for you are mine too,
				I will shatter her spine,
				with a slight whiff of a coup,
				Feed her to the mines,
				or poison her soup,
				So I guess ha ha ha,
				always a slave remains true.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I will raise her to loathe you,
				that's more than you deserve,
				She won't cater for or cloth you,
				even as your declining years arrive,
				I will coerce her to lock you,
				and your wounds to preserve,
				In the end, she will choke you,
				just enough to leave you alive.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Remember this Diana,
				with a song from the mansion,
				there is nothing like karma, Santa,
				or black fashion, terms invented by grandma,
				justifying her selfish kind actions,
				so do not be a charmer, by giving slaves bigger rations, 
				do you want to be the next governor?
				Be a master with passion,
				White Diamond you are and slavery is your calling."
