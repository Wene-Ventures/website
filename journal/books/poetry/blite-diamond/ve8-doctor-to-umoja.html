        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                As-salamu Alaykum, my kids,
                brothers, and sisters,
                Blessed are the wombs,
                that carried your glitter,
                But cursed are the rooms,
                whose floors kiss your blisters,
                Try to contain your fumes,
                and listen to your vicar.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Oh, Alhamdullilah,
                for the duty I am given,
                Kuwafut’ majeraha,
                and fix your skin partitions,
                How can peace be my mantra,
                while my people are power-driven,
                I deny being Alexander,
                but get failed with my ambitions.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                When I look at your skin,
                all I say is Mashallah,
                Together you look like twins,
                even without any attire,
                I applaud your tolerance for grins,
                from everyone else but Mary (vicar) and Abul-lah,
                Continue pulling up your chin,
                and patiently quenching your fire.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Siwezi kuelezea,
                uchungu niubebao,
                Watoto wangu wacheza,
                ila nyi’ mwafanywa ngao,
                Ingawa si twajikweza,
                mwajenga yetu makao,
                Japo sasa wawaweza,
                siku’ mtaenda zao.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                You are always good to me,
                Jazaka Allahu Khairan,
                Remember me when you flee,
                for I will remain your biggest fan,
                If your chief agrees,
                could I please join your clan?
                For since the moment I converted,
                my people’s animosity began.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                A bunch of your flock die from flue,
                simply because you bring them late,
                Nothing I can do for you,
                can alter your sad and cursed fate,
                Most of the time I have no clue,
                if any of us will enter the gates,
                I believe Allah will see you through,
                for in his time, he fills all plates.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I have keys to your freedom,
                but will hold them close for now,
                The re-birth of your kingdom,
                will bring us ruin without a doubt,
                In time your tribe will be reborn,
                for now, just accept it somehow,
                The world is not ready for reform,
                especially through a bleed-out.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Remember this Diana,
                with a song from the mansion,
                there is nothing like karma, Santa,
                or black fashion, terms invented by grandma,
                justifying her selfish kind actions,
                so do not be a charmer, by giving slaves bigger
                rations, do you want to be the next governor?
                Be a master with passion,
                White Diamond you are and slavery is your calling."
