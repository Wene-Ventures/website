        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                You aren't worthy of a sorry,
                from me, my wife, or my kitty,
                A man who goes to share his story,
                to the world just to get pity,
                What about my unheard story,
                When I went to the far city?
                You claimed my territory,
                and defiled this Holy city.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I told you what I would do,
                if you ever disappoint me,
                I needed to get through to you,
                and to get you on your knees,
                Be thankful I respected you,
                enough to not add a kin,
                Oh wait, I did that to you,
                don't ever forget I'm the King.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Though it was revenge for your sons,
                I couldn't look past that,
                You gave me a feeling that burns,
                when you slaughtered my pussy cat,
                So what I did in return,
                is to summon your wife from your hut,
                And I gave her a big handgun,
                and taught her to shoot a rat splat.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                She tasted just as advertised,
                I wonder which of us knows her more,
                Your feelings are not authorized,
                kindly escape from feeling sore,
                It is just my right I exercised,
                women are just tools to explore,
                Why do you look surprised?
                Because I did a better score?
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Diamond is not your daughter,
                so please stop treating her like one,
                Give her nothing but freshwater,
                if it's mangoes, give her the ripe ones,
                Don't take her where cows are slaughtered,
                especially those cute white ones,
                Always bring her to my quarters,
                when she is sick, pale, or looks down.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Most of times I do get scared,
                that you'll take my daughter and run,
                I look at how you take care,
                and make it so she has more fun,
                She makes my vision impaired,
                ever since her precious life began,
                She came when I was not prepared,
                but after her, I think I am done.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                Victor is truly a mad man,
                I wonder how you are all still alive,
                The worst brother under the sun,
                but it's through him we masters thrive,
                My message for you and your clan,
                is simply easy to archive,
                You will never be a free man,
                for as long as I am alive.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Remember this Diana,
                with a song from the mansion,
                there is nothing like karma, Santa,
                or black fashion, terms invented by grandma,
                justifying her selfish kind actions,
                so do not be a charmer, by giving slaves bigger
                rations, do you want to be the next governor?
                Be a master with passion,
                White Diamond you are and slavery is your calling."
