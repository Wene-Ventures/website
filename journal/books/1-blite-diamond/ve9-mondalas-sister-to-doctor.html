        <div class="poem"> 
            <p class="stanza">
                Doctor, I am in a lot of pain,
                since I went to visit master victor,
                He told me to go again,
                but never come to see you, doctor,
                For saying this I will get caned,
                every time victor is in charge,
                But I can't stand my thigh pains,
                and the random back discharge.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I have been having weird dreams,
                of being chased by a hell hound,
                I just wake myself up with screams,
                finding myself down on the ground,
                I get scared of the moonbeams,
                and even crickets make me breathe aloud,
                He really broke me badly it seems,
                I always feel goosebumps all around.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I can't get him off my mind,
                no matter how hard I try,
                It surely feels like I am blind,
                due to the love I have for that guy,
                Although at first, I had declined,
                I feel I am no longer shy,
                If he dares play with my mind,
                I will take an eye for an eye.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                When I am in his quarters,
                he usually wants me on four limbs,
                He says it makes me look hotter,
                I don't even know what that means,
                He calls me his daughter,
                so I feel like I should please him,
                What is wrong with me doctor?
                Am I wrong to think I am a queen?
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I hope he isn't tired of me,
                so I can take care of my mother,
                His sisters dare make fun of me,
                not knowing I own their brother,
                His wife takes very good care of me,
                poor vicar doesn't know I own her lover,
                I know you too want a taste of me,
                but you can control your hunger.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I wish I could get locked,
                so I could be free and be done,
                Or that victor could get chocked,
                so he could be gone and done,
                Even harder than iron or rock,
                my soft little heart has become,
                It took my all to have this talk,
                Doctor tell me what should be done?
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                I now know what I should go do,
                search for a rope and gladly fly,
                Because ropes are hard to come through,
                I could use your long strong black tie,
                Or maybe I should start a coup,
                and fight so hard until I die,
                I really don't know what to do,
                simply put I need to say bye-bye.
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "Kumbuka haya Mondala,
                with a song from the cabin,
                mateso ya fimbonyala, is more than you can imagine,
                bila viatu au ndala, a towel or a napkin,
                masaa matatu kulala, before the dogs start barking,
                treated like a gorilla, what a life it has been,
                Black Diamond you are and freedom is your calling."
