        <h3 class="subtitle">Ve1b - Mondala's Mother</h3>
        <p class="description">"Blite Diamond's biological mother, and Paul's concuibine"</p>
 
        <div> 
            <p>Mondala's mother was one of the slaves bought from Tanzania. She had four children when she arrived at her master's palace, with three sons and one daughter. Her beauty and intellect favored her, and she was assigned to work in the main house where PAUL (Diana's father) lived. Little did she know that this was the beginning of all her bittersweet troubles. </p>
            <p>Paul fancied her and wanted her for himself. He and his wife tried to get a child for many years but were unsuccessful. Being the leader of the white community without a child took a toll on him and caused him to start sleeping around with his maids, including Mondala's mother. Because he fancied her most and slept with her more frequently, he did not force her to abort the child. Instead, he cared for the mother and the child out of love and pride. </p>
            <p>This caused a lot of problems for Mondala's mother, from both her masters (The white community) and her fellow slaves (the black community). Her masters knew that this child would be a problem to their status, as she couldn't be treated as a slave or a master, while her fellow slaves took her pregnancy to be a betrayal to their whole community. </p>
            <p>Despite all these troubles and several attacks, both verbally and physically, from both communities, she endures all and gives birth to the first mixed-race child in their community. She vows to protect her with her life and to be the best mom. As the child's father names her Diana and her husband, who is the child's stepdad, names her Mondala, she decides to create a name that will not bind her to one side. Because of this, she names her daughter Diamond. Because the child is both black and white, the community makes a name to show their distaste for her called Blite, which represents (Black-white). Ultimately, the child's name becomes Blite Diamond. </p>
            <p>Mondala's mother, in her letter to Diana's father, expresses her feelings of pain, betrayal, and disgust towards him. She talks about how he made her little sisters prostitutes for his friends to enjoy and how he cut her son's reproductive organs so they could focus on work and not reproduce. She addresses the troubles she faced from being pregnant and how she wishes it was her husband who gave her the blessing of the child. She talks about the punishment she had to receive from her master's barren wife just because she bore her husband a child. She compares her current condition and considers it worse than when she had to fight lions to survive back at her home. Nevertheless, she resorts to being grateful for her newborn child and wishes that she will be allowed to be a mother to her and that her father will not take her away from her. </p>
